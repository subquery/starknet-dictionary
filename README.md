# SubQuery - Starknet Dictionary

This special SubQuery Project provides a dictionary of data that pre-indexes events on chain to dramatically improve indexing the performance of your own SubQuery Project, sometimes up to 10x faster.

It scans over the network, and simply records the module and method for every event/extrinsic on each block - please see the standard entities in `schema.graphql`.
